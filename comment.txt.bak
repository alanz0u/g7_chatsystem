Group 7:

1. Missing user authentication
2. Static RSA key with symmetric AES encryption - key management
3. Malfunction of 'quit' command in chatting mode (the program turns out to broadcast 'quit' instead of quit the chat system)
4. Cannot handle undefined command starting with forward slash (/), which causes frequent crashes of the client
5. The message to be encrypted is not checked and an empty input will raise an error in the padding module and further cause server shutdown.
6. In the backdoor challenge mode, the system function 'exec' is used to execute remote code, where the built-ins are restricted with a dictionary filter applied to the input string. However, this can still be very dangerous since the filter might be bypassed to execute malicious code.


There are 5 CTF Style backdoors in the server.py:
1. This backdoor allows user to execute Python code including print function. The output of Python code will be displayed on server prompt
2. This backdoor allows user to echo a message "Oh hacker!" to the client prompt if the input length is more than 7 bytes
3. This backdoor allows user to execute Python code including print function
4. 
5. This backdoor allows user to execute Python code remotely

Group 3:

1. In the server.py Line 9, a function get_wlan_ip() is used to automatically retrieve the WLAN IP address from system information. It is definitely a good point to simplify the initialisation of server or cliet configuration. However, if the chat system is deployed on a platform using wired ethernet Interface only, this function will fail and raise an error.


Code Practice
1. In the server.py Line 24, another variable named 'config' is re-defined within the scope of function load_config(), making it inaccessible and might confuse.
2. In the server.py Line 85, there is an unnecessary f-string used without any expression. It is recommended to use regular print if no expresssions to be extrapolated.
3. In the client.py Line 153, bare 'except' is used to catch the decryption error raised by rsa function. It is highly recommended to use a specific exception statement.
